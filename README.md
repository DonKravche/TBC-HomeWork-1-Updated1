This is the same task as TBC_HomeWork1 but more widespread and sophisticated
Registration is successful. Ideally, I store variables in strings, with the help of which I perform actions on them. The project has one problem and it is that when we register with Email: test@gmail.com, Password: test 123 and log in with Email: test@gmail.com Password: test 321 or any other password, the application closes instead of throwing an error message box. The main purpose of this app is to simulate user registration and interface.
